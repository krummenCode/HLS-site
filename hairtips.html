        <!--Styling Tips-->
        <h2>Styling Tips</h2>
        <p>- Change the part from one side to the other or make your part a zigzag.
          It’s simple and easy.
        </p>
        <p>- Flip up the ends, turn the ends under or square them off with a flat iron.</p>
        <p>- Set the hair in self adhering rollers after blow drying it.</p>
        <p>- Use a silicone spray to change the texture.</p>
        <p>- Apply pomade for body and shine. </p>
        <p>- Create a retro look with pin curls.</p>
        <p> - Scrunch the hair using a finishing spray.</p>
        <p>- Add curls with a curling iron.</p>
        <p>- Apply a texturizing crème by raking your fingers through your hair
          as you blow dry. This will create a messy ‘second day’ look.
        </p>
        <p>- Twirl the hair around a pencil and apply heat for a few seconds.</p>
        <p>- Mix up sizes of sponge rollers to create less uniform curls.</p>
        <p>- Create half up do’s or full up do’s and add hair accessories.</p>
        <p>- Add braids.</p>
        <p>- Tuck the hair behind the ears or pull it forward for an easy change.</p>
        <!--Face  Shapes-->
        <br />
        <h2>Face Shapes</h2>
        <p>Round Face This face shape has about the same width as length. If you
          have a round face, you want to elongate the face and give it more definition.
          Longer lengths (below the chin) with face framing layers work great. A
          deep side part also creates a slimming illusion.
        </p>
        <p>Heart Face This face is wider at the forehead and narrower at the chin
          and jaw. A deep side part with a chin length cut balances the face shape.
          Keep the style soft and add long layers around the face. Small bangs also
          provide a nice dimension.
        </p>
        <p>Oval Face This face shape is well proportioned – the length is about one
          and a half times the width and can wear almost any hair style.
        </p>
        <p>Square Face This face is defined by wide cheekbones, a broad forehead
          and a wide jaw line. Off center parts and face framing layers work wonders
          with the facial shape. Rounder bangs help to soften the edges too.
        </p>
        <p>Pear FaceThis face is narrow at the forehead and wider at the chin and
          jaw. A haircut with width and height balances this face shape. Adding
          volume to the crown can really bring attention to the eyes.
        </p>
        <p>Long Face This face has a length longer than the width. Shorter, chin
          length hair styles with a wide bang help add necessary width to an elongated face.
        </p>
        <p>Large Nose A suggestion when dealing with a larger nose is to keep hair
          longer, adding soft layers around the sides and on top of the head, paired
          with a soft bang.
        </p>
        <p>Wide Forehead Bangs cut short enough to balance the width of the face is
          a great suggestion for a wide forehead.
        </p>
        <p>Narrow Forehead We suggest a bang cut back somewhat to help extend the
          width of the forehead.
        </p>
        <p>Vertical or Horizontal Balance your face with a hair cut that leads the
          eye in the opposite direction. For example, if your face is too narrow –
          ask your stylist to build width into your hairstyle or if your face is too
          wide – ask the stylist to add more height in your hairstyle.
        </p>
        <p>Thick Neck Soften a less than swan-like neck with long layers and soft
          movement in and around the neck area
        </p>
        <p>Narrow Neck We recommend to cut your hair just above the shoulders with
          layers or into a bob to downplay a narrow neck.
        </p>
        <!--Steps-->
        <br />
        <h2>SMOOTH, SLEEK, STRAIGHT HAIR</h2>
        <p>Step 1: After shampooing hair, blot hair dry - never vigorously towel
          dry curly, wet hair.
        </p>
        <p>Step 2: Use a leave in conditioner to coat and protect the hair. We
          recommend the Aquage Hydrating Mist.
        </p>
        <p>Step 3: Apply a straightening product to support your efforts. Make sure
          to distribute the product through the hair evenly by combing from scalp
          to ends. We recommend the Aquage Straightening Ultra Gel.
        </p>
        <p>Step 4: Blow dry the hair starting with half-inch sections in the nape
          using a boar-bristle brush or a flat brush. Work up the head making certain
          each section is dry and straight. Apply as much tension as necessary and
          don’t be afraid of using heat.
        </p>
        <p>Step 5: Once hair is dry and straight, go over large sections with a flat
          iron to ensure the style remains straight. We recommend Aquage Beyond Shine
          when flat ironing the hair.
        </p>
        <p class="italicize">Tips: Allow the hair to cool while it’s still in the brush to prevent it
          from reverting curl. If the hair air dries as you work, it will become too
          curly. Spritz the hair down with water before blowing drying it straight
          and re-spritz when necessary
        </p>
        <!--COMMUNICATING-->
        <br />
        <h2>COMMUNICATING WITH YOUR STYLIST</h2>
        <p>Receiving the perfect haircut is all about the communication. You talk.
          The stylist listens and then offers leadership, knowledge, expertise and
          styling options. Think about the following points when talking with your stylist:
        </p>
        <p>1. What do you like best about your hair?</p>
        <p>2. How much time do you want to spend on your hair? </p>
        <p>3. What don’t you like about your hair and what problems need to be addressed?</p>
        <p>4. Do you have any parameters about your style?</p>
        <p>5. Do you have any length considerations?</p>
        <p>6. Do you have pictures to help accurately describe your desired style?</p>
